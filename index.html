            <h1>Rings</h1>
            <p>There's more to Mangata & Gallo than our iconic engagement rings. Why not choose a ring for every finger? 
                Mix gold, silver, platinum and diamond bands in a head-turning stack or style them side by side on each 
                finger for maximum impact. Engrave a gold signet ring, usually worn on your pinky, for a hero piece that 
                only gets better with time. Make your next bold statement a cocktail ring that gets everyone talking colorful
                gemstones optional but highly recommended. When it comes to Mangata&Gallo rings, a full hand wins every time. </p>
